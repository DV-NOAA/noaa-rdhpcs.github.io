            | Matt Long demonstrated enhancements to Parallel Works
              features:
            -  Updates to Notifications, with expanded notification
               types and email notification options
            -  Short term credentials, which can be used effectively for
               cluster and storage resources
            -  Updates to the Marketplace feature. Cluster and storage
               configurations can now be shared with team members
               through the Marketplace.
            -  Lustre configurations can now be designated persistent,
               and saved separately from the clusters. This potentially
               saves storage costs.
