    Gaea
    ^^^^^

    Gaea is located in Oak Ridge National Laboratory at ORNLâ€™s National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS). This Climate Modeling and Research System (CMRS) is accessed remotely through two 10-gigabit WAN connections. Gaea is the largest of four NOAA research and development HPC systems.

    Hera
    ^^^^^

    Hera is located at NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC) in Fairmont, West Virginia. It is Cray System. The compute capacity of Hera supports the development of weather modeling across the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and National Weather Service to improve the prediction of high-impact weather events and evaluate potential future directions for models and data assimilation.

    Jet
    ^^^^

    Jet primarily supports the HPC needs of the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program (HFIP), numerical weather prediction, and other weather research. Since 2009, Jet has been used to run real-time jobs, via reservation schemes in the batch scheduler, to support HFIP during hurricane season and various other high-priority R2O projects.

    Niagara
    ^^^^^^^^

    The Niagara system is  a collaborative resource where data can be securely copied to and from any location, by any authorized user. It can also be used as a service to disseminate research and development data to NOAA's collaborators around the globe.
