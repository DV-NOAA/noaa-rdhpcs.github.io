System Overview
===============

`Gaea <https://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/gaea>`_
is an `NOAA Research and Development High-Performance Computing System
(RDHPCS) <https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/hpcc>`_ operated
by the `National Climate-Computing Research Center (NCRC)
<https://www.ncrc.gov/>`_.  The NCRC is located within the
`National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)
<https://www.ornl.gov/division/nccs>`_ at the `Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) <https://www.ornl.gov/>`_.   The NCRC is a
collaborative effort between the `Department of Energy
<https://www.energy.gov/>`_ and the `National Atmospheric and Oceanic
Administration <https://www.noaa.gov/>`.

The Gaea System consists of two HPE Cray XC40 systems, with an
aggregate of more than 200 terabytes of memory and a peak
calculating capacity greater than 5.25 petaflops.

Gaea uses a high-capacity Lustre file system with over 32 petabytes
of storage.  The file system is connected to the Gaea system using
FDR InfiniBand.
