Welcome to the NOAA RDHPCS Cloud Computing Platform. The Cloud Platform allows NOAA users to create an HPC cluster on an as-needed basis, with the type of resources that are appropriate for the task at hand.

You can find directions to log into the NOAA RDHPCS Cloud Gateway [https://noaa.parallel.works/ here].

== Parallel Works User Guide ==

NOAA Cloud Computing uses the Parallel Works software application, in a version customized for NOAA RDHPCS.  The Parallel Works User Guide is their standard documentation. NOAA users will find minor differences, for example, the login authentication, and project allocation, between the standard and customized applications.

We recommend the Parallel Works User Guide for comprensive information about the product. Users should click the FAQ link located on the sidebar to learn about the NOAA RDHPCS-specific topics.
