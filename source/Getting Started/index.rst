Once you have  a NOAA.gov email address, you can request an RDHPCS account. 
Visit the Account Information Management (AIM) website (https://aim.rdhpcs.noaa.gov) and  request access to the RDHPCS project.  Log into AIM using your NOAA email credentials, review your profile for accuracy, and request the RDHPCS project.

Once this request is approved, you will receive an email containing instructions about your next steps. These include requesting access to further projects and completing the RSA token request form.  Confer with your supervisor and colleagues to identify the  project(s) to request.

''RSA Software Token'''


RSA software tokens provide two factor authentication (2FA) for NOAA RDHPCS systems for SSH access. When you’re assigned to your first project, the RSA token form will be used to assign your software token. Your RSA token will include instructions about how to initialize it. You can find more information on RSA tokens here: Logging in - rdhpcs-common-docs (noaa.gov). NOTE:  If you don’t have a smartphone, you can request an RSA hardware token. The activation process is found here: New User Activation <https://rdhpcs-common-docs.rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php/New_User_Activation#RSA_Token_Activation>'_ .  RSA software tokens are preferred.

''CAC Access'''

The Common Access Card (CAC), is the preferred means of access to RDHPCS resources for both Web and SSH access. To obtain a CAC, work with your local admin services team as they need to start the application process.  Some labs can issue CACs on-site, otherwise you will have to visit a RAPIDS site. The site locator website is ID Card Office Online (osd.mil).  SSH logins with a CAC require additional software detailed here:  CAC Login - ,https://rdhpcs-common-docs>' _ .
