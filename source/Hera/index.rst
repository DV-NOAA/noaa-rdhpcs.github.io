# About NESCC #

The NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC), located in Fairmont, West Virginia, is the location of NOAA's newest High Performance Computing Data Center. This site provides computing resources to support NOAA's research in Weather and Climate modeling as well as its other environmental research areas.

There are currently two major systems at NESCC:

- Hera - A 760 Tflop Cray Compute Cluster high performance computing system
- HPSS - A 50 Petabyte IBM/Oracle hierarchical storage management system.

Hera System Features:

- Capacity of 3,270 trillion floating point operations per second â€“ or 3.27 petaflops
- The Fine Grain Graphical Processing Units have a total capacity of 2,000 trillion floating point operations per second, or 2.0 petaflops
- 45 million hours per month with 63,840 cores and a total scratch disk capacity of 18.5 Petabytes.

NESCC is also home to Niagara, a cloud-based computing resource. In addition, Test and Development systems are available through NESCC for system and application testing.
