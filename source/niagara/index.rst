Introduction
------------

As NOAA's R&D severe weather and climate projects expand  to geographically dispersed private and public HPC clouds, it is imperative that the the NOAA RDHPCS program provide a service for data dissemination and analysis outside of the traditional HPC environment. The Niagara system is intended to be a collaborative location where data can be securely copied to and from any location, by any authorized user. It can also be used to disseminate R&D data to NOAA's collaborators around the globe.

The Niagara system includes:

- Back-end storage
- Data Transfer Nodes
- Interactive Nodes
- Software
- Account Management.

Users can connect to the Data Transfer Nodes (DTN) from any remote system to push or pull data. Beyond the Back-end storage and DTNs, the cluster allows for data analysis, visualization, verification, validation and data analytics. It is provided through a combination of hardware and software, which mirrors the user environment and a subset of the tools available on the legacy RDHPCS systems (Hera & Jet) and legacy Analysis systems (PPAN), but can also include software which is unique to this system and not traditionally found on traditional HPC systems.

Niagara System Features:

- 20 cores/socket, 2.5 GHz, 2 sockets/nodes
- 12 Login Nodes
- 25 Compute Nodes
- 2 DTNs available from trusted (pre-approved) NOAA and non-NOAA sites
- 2 Untrusted Data Transfer Nodes (UDTNs) available from anywhere on the internet
- 2 Web servers
